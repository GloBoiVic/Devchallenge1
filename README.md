## Overview

Hello, I am Vic. I am interested in all things coding. I had fun with this challenge.

- You can see the demo of this project on <a href="https://globoivic.github.io/Devchallenge1/">Github</a>
- I first found this challenge a while back and it has been on the back burner for a while. At first, I could not figure out how to use flexbox so I hit the books.
- After learning flexbox and its magical features, I was able to tackle this challenge easily. Very beginner friendly indeed.
- As we self-taught aspiring software developer, I have to stay motivated and hold myself accountable to continue the grind, continue learning all that I can, and practice! Practice what I learn. Looking forward to the next challenge.
